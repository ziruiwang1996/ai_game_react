                        <p>Meet Liam with his special toy mouse! But this isn‚Äôt just any ordinary toy‚Äîit has been programmed by Zirui to learn and adapt using Temporal Difference (TD) learning, a powerful reinforcement learning technique.</p>
                        <p><b>How It Works:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The toy mouse (represented as a small blue circle) learns from experience, continuously improving its ability to evade Liam.</li>
                            <li>Liam (represented as a larger red circle) tries to catch the mouse.</li>
                            <li>The mouse doesn‚Äôt rely on pre-programmed paths‚Äîit actively learns from each attempt, updating its strategy to avoid getting caught.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>The Power of TD Learning:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Predict and adapt: TD learning helps the mouse estimate the future value of different actions by predicting the rewards they might yield.</li>
                            <li>Real-time decision-making: With every move, the mouse updates its knowledge, improving its ability to escape.</li>
                            <li>Optimizing behavior: Over time, the mouse refines its strategy, making it increasingly difficult for Liam to catch it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Can Liam outsmart his learning toy, or will the mouse keep slipping away? Watch as reinforcement learning unfolds in real time!<br/>
                        Set the game in motion and see if Liam can finally catch his clever little mouse! üê≠üî•</p>
